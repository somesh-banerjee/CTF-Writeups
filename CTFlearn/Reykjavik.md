[**Problem**](https://ctflearn.com/challenge/990) (Easy,Reverse Engineering)

So this is my first Reversing challenge. Before attempting this I have an idea about
- assembly language
- how to use gdb in linux 
- registers

With basic knowledge of this two topic, this challenge can be easily solved. Follow the given links to know more about this topics.

You have to disassemble the file and have to run it one instruction at a time. Before you approach any jump statement do the necessary changes to the registers, 
so that you get the flag. Make a flow diagram like in this [video](https://youtu.be/VroEiMOJPm8). It will be easier to find out where to change the registers value.
