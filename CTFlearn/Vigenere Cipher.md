[**Problem**](https://ctflearn.com/challenge/305)

From the only we can understand it is a viginere code and we will decrypt it to get the flag

I used [this](https://www.dcode.fr/vigenere-cipher) to decrypt.

Note

In the encoded message
```
blorpy gwox{RgqssihYspOntqpxs}
```

blorpy is the key and the rest is the encoded message
