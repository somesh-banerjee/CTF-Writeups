[*Challenge*](https://www.wechall.net/challenge/training/regex/index.php)

## Level 1

> Your objective in this challenge is to learn the regex syntax.
> Regular Expressions are a powerful tool in your way to master programming, so you should be able to solve this challenge, at least!
> The solution to every task is always the shortest regular expression pattern possible.
> Also note that you have to submit delimiters in the patterns too. Example pattern: /joe/i. The delimiter has to be /

> Your first lesson is easy: submit the regular expression the matches an empty string, and only an empty string.

Start and end of a string is denoted by ^ and $ respectively. As the string is empty it will be simply /^$/

## Level 2

> Easy enough. Your next task is to submit a regular expression that matches only the string 'wechall' without quotes.

w is the start and l is end. So the regex is /^wechall$/

## Level 3

> Ok, matching static strings is not the main goal of regular expressions.
> Your next task is to submit an expression that matches valid filenames for certain images.
> Your pattern shall match all images with the name wechall.ext or wechall4.ext and a valid image extension.
> Valid image extensions are .jpg, .gif, .tiff, .bmp and .png.
> Here are some examples for valid filenames: wechall4.tiff, wechall.png, wechall4.jpg, wechall.bmp
